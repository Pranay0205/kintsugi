# Kintsugi

Kintsugi (named after the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold) is a research prototype designed to analyze student programming submissions and illuminate invisible gaps in cybersecurity awareness. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Tracing (KT), it distinguishes between fundamental coding errors ("Skill Gaps") and overlooked security principles ("Awareness Gaps") to inform more resilient curriculum design.
